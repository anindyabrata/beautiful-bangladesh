The cemetery contains 736 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War. It was established and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), to pay tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in World War II. It is situated in the Comilla Cantonment area.

Before the war Maynamati was a hamlet of a few dozen huts, but during the war a large military camp was established there. Several ordnance depots and a number of military hospitals, both British and Indian, were in the area, including Nos. 14 and 150 British General Hospitals; and the majority of the burials in Maynamati War Cemetery were from the various hospitals. Graves from isolated places in the surrounding country, and some from as far afield as Burma, were moved into the cemetery by the Army Graves Service and later on by the Commission; and it was found necessary to transfer also graves from small cemeteries at Dacca, Faridpur, Paksay, Saidpur, Santahan and Sirajgany, where they could not be maintained.

The cemetery was started by the Army and laid out by the garrison engineer. It is dominated by a small flat-topped hill crowned with indigenous flowering and evergreen trees. Between the entrance and this hill lie the Christian graves, and on the far side of it are the Muslim graves. On a terrace about half-way up the hill, facing the entrance, stands the Cross of Sacrifice, and on the other side a shelter looks over the Muslim graves to a tree-framed view of the countryside beyond.

 <h1 style="color:red;">Baliati Palace</h1>
 <img src="assets/images/baliati.jpg" width="800px" height="400px" /> <br> <br>
          <h3 style="color:green;">Description</h3>
          <p align="justify">The great Baliati Palace is located at the Saturia Upazila of Manikganj district, in the village of Baliati. This historic building is about 200 years of old. A river named Gazikhali which is demised interim of the time, flowed at the northern side of the palace.

The palace is situated on a lush and sprawling premise, approximately 16000 square meter. There are possibly 200 rooms available inside the premise. Back side of the palace has a pond having four ghats. Other side of the pond has a series of sanitary lavatory.

The story starts more than hundred and fifty years ago when the Baliati Zamindars were still a force to be reckoned with in Bangladesh, situated about 35 miles northwest of Dhaka and 5 miles east of Manikgonj district headquarters. The palaces used to be also known as “Dosh-ani-Zaminder bari” due to inheritance of a portion of the main complex from Roy Chand by the well wishers of his first wife among the Zaminders. Kishorilal Roy Chowdhury and Roybahadur Harendra Kumer Roy Chowdhury realized soon enough the necessity of knowledge which compelled them to establish the Jagarnath College and K.L Jubily High school. The Baliati Zaminderbari originally consisted of five similar but separate blocks. The south façade of grand palace presents an attractive frontage of about 400 feet of the extant four blocks of the palace, the two central blocks are two-storied and the other two terminal ones are three-storied. The lofty encircling walls of the imposing Zaminderbari complex are punctuated by three superb gateways, identical in their architectural features. This remarkable complex has been acquired by the Bangladesh archeological department and has been given a new name “Baliati Palace” as a protected cultural property.In exploring the expressiveness of this marvelous structure with time, culture and mood, the attached twelve snaps tell the story by  dividing it into three constituent parts. First part expresses the thematic preamble of time and prestige, and style. The second part sequentially put expedition of the underlying interior in the picture capturing architectural details, vista and shape and shadow. Last part tells the present story of the exterior in light of the surrounding at present. In short, the justification of making this sequential development to bring the whole story inside out from it’s behind theme to the present.
