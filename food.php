<h3 style="color:green;">Black rice</h3>
  <p align="justify">Black rice (also known as purple rice) is a range of rice types of the species Oryza sativa L., some of which are glutinous rice. Varieties include Indonesian black rice and Thai jasmine black rice. Black rice is known as Chak-hao in Manipur, an Indian state in the eastern border. Pudding made of Chak-hao is a popular dessert served to people at all major feasts in Manipur. Black rice is high in nutritional value and is a source of iron, vitamin E, and antioxidants (more than in blueberries). The bran hull (outermost layer) of black rice contains one of the highest levels of anthocyanin antioxidants found in food. The grain has a similar amount of fiber to brown rice and, like brown rice, has a mild, nutty taste.

Any type of rice may be eaten whole. Whole rice has a mild, nutty flavor, and is chewier and more nutritious than white rice.

<h3 style="color:green;">Chhena gaja</h3>
  <p align="justify">Unlike some other popular chhena-based Odia desserts, such as rasagola, which have spread throughout India, the chhena gaja remains largely popular within the state itself.

Although the ingredients of chhena gaja are essentially the same as that of rasagolla and chhena poda, the dishes are very different in taste.

One of the best places to savor chhena gajas is Pahala, near Bhubaneswar.[2] However, chhena gaja is equally popular all over Orissa.

It is made of well-kneaded homemade fresh cheese chhena, sugar, cashew nuts and raisins, and is baked for several hours until it browns. Chhena poda is the only well known Indian dessert whose flavor is predominantly derived from the caramelization of sugar.

<h3 style="color:green;">Dal</h3>
  <p align="justify">Dal (also spelled daal or dhal; pronunciation: [d̪aːl]) is a term in the Indian subcontinent for dried, split pulses (that is, lentils, peas, and beans). The term is also used for various soups prepared from these pulses. These pulses are among the most important staple foods in SAARC countries, and form an important part of Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi cuisines.

Dals are frequently eaten with flatbreads such as rottas or chapatis or with rice, a combination referred to as dal bhat. Dals are high in protein relative to other plants.

The outer hull is usually stripped off; dal that has not been hulled is described as chilka (skin), e.g. chilka urad dal, mung dal chilka in Hindi/Urdu. The term dal is often contrasted with the term gram, used in South Asia for pulses that are whole rather than split.

  <p align="justify">Luchi is a deep-fried flatbread made of wheat flour that is typical of Bengali, Assamese, Maithili and Oriya cuisine. In order to make luchis, a dough is prepared by mixing fine maida flour with water and a spoonful of ghee, which is then divided into small balls. These balls are flattened using a rolling-pin and individually deep-fried in cooking oil or ghee. A typical luchi will measure 4-5 inches in diameter. They are usually served with curries or gravies. If maida is substituted with atta, it is called a poori. Luchi that is stuffed is called kochuri; kochuri stuffed with mashed peas (koraishutir kochuri) is one notable variety.

Machher Jhol is liberally seasoned with turmeric, garlic, onions, and grated ginger. Potatoes are added to the stew as a thickening agent. Tomatoes are also added to impart the dish with a reddish color which is preferred by the people of Bengal.

The kinds of fish that typically used in Bengali and Oriya households are Hilsa (called Ilisi), Rohu (called Rohi), and Catla (called Bhakura). Apart from these, there are some famous small sized fish that are normally favoured over others.
