          <h3 style="color:green;">Description</h3>
          <p align="justify">Bisnakandi is a village situated in Rustompur Union under Guainghat Upazilla. This is where many layers of the Khasi mountain meet at a single point from both sides. Flowing from above is a high fall. Adding to its charm are dark clouds hugging the mountain in the rainy season. And flowing underneath towards Bholaganj is a branch of the Piyain. Along the stream flowing from high up in the mountain come huge boulders that are deposited and mined in Bisnakandi.
        Much like Jaflong, Bisnakandi is mostly a quarry. Winter is not a suitable time to visit Bisnakandi due to mechanised mining and stone-laden boats and lorries. The absence of such nuisance makes the rainy season the perfect time to visit the beautiful Bisnakandi that coalesces the charms of high mountains, sinuous rivers, graceful falls and dancing clouds.

</p>
          
          
 
 <h3 style="color:green;">How to Go</h3>
  <p align="justify">There is more than one way to go to Bisnakandi. Tourists can use the Sylhet-Guainghat Road via the airport and take a left turn to reach Hadarpar from where a local boat may be hired to arrive at Bisnakandi. Visitors can go to Hadarpar by CNG-run auto-rickshaws, which are available for hire at Amberkhana Point in Sylhet city. 

An alternative would be to go to Pangthumai first, and then hire a boat near Borhill Fall and ride along the branch of the Piyan which flows west towards Bisnakandi. The boat ride, which takes a little over an hour, on the sinuous river with lush green mountains on both sides is an unforgettable experience.

It consists of a series of beels connected to one another by various channels to form a continuous water body during the rainy season. Although the beel area expands into a vast water body with dense aquatic vegetation as long as the Jamuna remains flooded during the monsoon months, it dries out in the winter months, leaving only patches of water in the central parts of this zone.

Chalan Beel is fast silting up. In the past it covered an area of about 1,085 kmÂ² but was reduced to 368 kmÂ² in 1909, of which only 85 kmÂ² remained underwater throughout the year. It has since shrunk to only 26 kmÂ²</p>
